\notetitle{07a}{Perception}

Controversy
\begin{itemize}
\item Led to AI stagnating, though not immediately nor only because of this
\item Minsky and Papert book showed impossible to learn XOR
\item Often believed (incorrectly) that they claimed same result for multi-layer perceptron
\item ANN research resurgence in the 1980's
\end{itemize}

Algorithm
\begin{itemize}
\item Talk about binary classifier
\item Talk about bias term meaning
\item Talk about weights meaning
\item Talk about decision boundary
  \vspace{2mm}
\item Algorithm doesn't terminate if not linearly separable
\item Perceptron is the simplest instance of a feedforward neural network
  \vspace{2mm}
\item Initialize weights randomly (or to zero)
\item For each input, compute output
\item Update weights by adding $\alpha$ if correct
\end{itemize}

Convergence
\begin{itemize}
\item If not linearly separable, don't even get an approximate solution
\item If linearly separable, then upper bound on number of times weights updated
\item Solution quality not guaranteed
\item ``Perceptron of optimal stability'' now known as SVM
\end{itemize}
