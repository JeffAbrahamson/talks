\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Significance}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Flip a coin $N$ times.  Get 49\% heads.  Is the coin fair?
  \item Congress/parliament has $N$ members of whom $m$ are male.  Do
    we discriminate against women?
  \item Do we discriminate against women more or less than we
    discriminate against blacks?
  \item Email classification: spam or not?
  \item Careful about what we conclude.  Here we can't conclude
    anything about cause or source.
  \end{itemize}

  % This needs supporting slides with computations.  We'll also have
  % to come back to it when we understand about $p$ values and the
  % like.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Terminology}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item A \textbf{case} or {observational unit} is an observation or a
    single sample.  E.g., an email.
  \item A \textbf{variable} is a characteristic of an observational
    unit.  E.g., number of lines, mean line length, number of words.
  \end{itemize}
  \includegraphics[width=.9\textwidth]{variable-types.png}

  Notes:  Categorical is sometimes called nominal.  Categorical
  variables with logical ordering (empty, half, full) or called ordinal.
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Anecdote}

  Some properties of anecdote:
  
  \begin{itemize}
  \item is data
  \item haphazardly collected
  \item is generally not representative
  \item sometimes result of selective retention
  \item does not accumulate to be representative
  \item might be true (by chance)
  \item is ok to use as hypothesis, but be clear that hypothesis is anecdote

  }
  \note {
    Example:  Sunscreen use associated with skin cancer.  But sun
    exposure is a confounding variable.

    Observational studies: prospective (identify individuals, collect
    information) and retrospective.  (Can combine the two.)

  Can't generally conclude causation.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Experiment}

  We do stuff.  Maybe randomised experiment.
  
  \note{
    If well-designed, can conclude causation.

    Experiments to generate hypotheses vs experiments to demonstrate
    hypotheses.  (Don't use the same data!)

    Example: Phase 0 (10 people) and phase 1 (20-100 people) clinical trials are not randomised.

    Phase 0:  Pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics, particularly oral
    bioavailability and half-life of the drug.  Very small,
    subtherapeutic doses.

    Phase 1:  Testing of drug on healthy volunteers for dose-ranging.
    Often subtherapeutic, but with ascending doses.  Determine whether
    a drug is safe to check for efficacy in phase 2.

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Simple random sampling}

  Uniform and independent.

  \note{
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Each case has the same probability of being included.
    \item Knowing that a particular case is included provides no useful information about other cases.
    \end{itemize}

    Example: Footballers in Europe, put all the names in a bucket.

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Stratified Sampling}

  Group like with like, then usually simple random sampling of each stratum.
  
  \note{
    Divide and conquer.

    Example:  Footballers in Europe, sample $k$ from each team.
    (Hypothesis:  footballers are paid about the same within a team.)

  }

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Cluster Sampling}

  Simple random sampling to form clusters, then simple random
  sampling.

  \note{
    Example:  Sample $k$ from each village.  Works if villages have high
    diversity, not so much if villages are substantially different from
    one another.

    Example:  Ebola.  SRS expensive (census of each village, then
    maybe have to visit them all).  So select $n$ villages and sample
    $k$ within each.  Hope that villages are similar enough that this
    is valid as a first step.

  \only<1>{Students at an elementary school are given a questionnaire
    that they are required to return after their parents have
    completed it. One of the questions asked is, “Do you find that
    your work schedule makes it difficult for you to spend time with
    your kids after school?” Of the parents who replied, 85\% said
    “no”. Based on these results, the school officials conclude thata
    great majority of the parents have no difficulty spending time
    with their kids after school.

    women who recently gave birth, asking them about whether or not they
    smoked during pregnancy. A follow-up survey asking if the children
    have respiratory problems is conducted 3 years later, however, only
    567 of these women are reached at the same address. The researcher
    reports that these 567 women are representative of all mothers.

  \only<3>{An orthopedist administers a questionnaire to 30 of his
