histograms.py - File to share with code for producing various
histograms.  Let people work through it.  Then propose game:  in
pairs, one generates an interesting histogram, the other tries to
figure out how to dufplicate (given some good hints or outright
instructions on how to prepare the data).

seaborn-violin-citation - for completeness, not for in class.

seaborn-violin.py - intro to seaborn, for after histograms.

ab_testing.py - Exercises for A/B tests.  Probably worth revealing at
the board one by one rather than sharing the file straight off.  Box
plots, violin plots, bean plots, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.  Exercises
with time series.
