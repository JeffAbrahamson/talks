anscombe.py - demo of anscombe's quartet.  Exercise:  suppose data set
were larger and multidimensional, what are some of the things you
could do.  Simulate by adding dimensions, e.g. using pandas or numpy.

linear_regression_1.py - guided script for discovering linear
regression tools.  Exercise:  change noise level and residual
distribution.

logistic.py - logistic regression example.  Mostly to show linear vs
logistic regression.

diabetes_regression.py - simple regression example, more a reminder
that sklearn comes with cool data sets to play with.  Exercise: look
in the diabetes data and visualize / separate / predict something else.

lr-confidence-numpy.py - confidence intervals in linear regression,
the hard way.

lr-confidence-scipy.py - confidence intervals in linear regression, a
bit easier.

lr-seaborn.py - the easy way to do confidence intervals in linear
regression.  Also an introduction to seaborn.

plot_cv_predict.py - Demonstrate cross validation and how we might
measure it.  Talk about how cross validation works, the importance of
not validating on training data, and OVR (OVA) vs one-on-one.

under-over-fitting.py - demonstrate under and over fitting.  Discuss
first Lagrange's formula and uniqueness of n-1 degree polynomial fit.
Talk about barrier functions.


advanced/iris_logistic.py - Some rather practical examples of linear
regression on real data.  We'll want to talk about what sklearn's
bunches are.

advanced/multi_face.py - Some kind of dumb CV algorithms for
completing faces.  TODO:  Look up Ridge CV etc.


lr-seaborn-citation - for after class completeness.
