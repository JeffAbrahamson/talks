    My goal is to understand computer science and machine learning.

    Our goal this week is to understand statistics and to use python
    to help us.  Not to learn anything in particular about python.

    First edition of this course.  Your feedback is important.  Even in real time.

    This subject is vast.  So is curiosity.\\
    If I'm stumped, I'll follow on, at least with pointers to reading material.
