WTF is Deep Learning?

Neither machine learning nor deep learning are new topics, but they
have both seen remarkable advancement in the last decade.  As is often
the case in a rapidly advancing field, new vocabulary is born.

In this talk we'll look at what we now call deep learning, its
origins, and its applications.  The talk strives to present the
subject to a technical audience with little to no knowledge of deep
learning.  As adult viewers of Saturday morning cartoons would expect,
the presentation will nonetheless strive to provide some amusement and
maybe enlightenment for experienced practitioners.
