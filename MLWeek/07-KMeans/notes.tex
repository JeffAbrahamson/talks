\fbox{Silhouette coefficient}
\begin{itemize}
\item Measures compactness, separation
\item Large for well-separated compact clusters
\item Small for large, overlapping clusters
\item Dissimilarity: we can use distance.
\item Average dissimilarity of $d_i$ to cluster $k_j$ is average of
  distances from $d_i$ to all the points in $k_j$.
\item $\overline{s_i}$ for a cluster measures cluster goodness
\item $\overline{s_i}$ overall measures general goodness
\end{itemize}
