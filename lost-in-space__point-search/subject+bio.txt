Lost in Space: binary search trees beyond dimension one

BST's are a great general-purpose tool for locating points on the
line.  But in higher dimensions, we have to do more work.  In this
talk, we'll look at a handful of algorithms that let us search for
points, ranges of points, and nearest points in higher dimensions --
just like with BST's.  We'll also touch on some surprising
applications of these algorithms and even have a quick chat about the
Curse of Dimensionality.  The talk keeps evolving, but it's a safe bet
that we'll at least discuss range trees, kd-trees, and higher
dimensional Voronoi diagrams.
