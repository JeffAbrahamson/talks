Lost in Space: binary search trees beyond dimension one

BST's are a great general-purpose tool for locating points on the
line.  In higher dimensions, we have to do more work.  In this talk,
we'll look at a handful of algorithms that let us search for points,
ranges of points, and nearest points, all in higher dimensions -- just
like with BST's.  We'll also touch on some surprising applications of
these algorithms and even have a quick chat about the Curse of
Dimensionality.  The talk keeps evolving, but it's a safe bet that
we'll at least discuss range trees, kd-trees, and higher dimensional
Voronoi diagrams.
