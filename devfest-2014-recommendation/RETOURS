Suggestions for improvement:

- Talk about libraries that exist, at least giving pointers.  Make
  clear that the point is to give intuition, that one is rarely
  obliged to program these things.

- For a talk at this level, I probably could have skipped much
  discussion of Amazon Item-to-Item and Slope One in favour of more
  intuition on the others.

- It would be interesting to work some examples with real data and
  show visualisations.  Say one pixel per datum and ten highlight what
  data are being selected at each step, for example.
