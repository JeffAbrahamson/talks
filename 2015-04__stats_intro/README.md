These are slides that accompany a training I do on statistical
inference with applications to machine learning and big data.  These
slides are not intended to stand on their own, and any usage outside
the context of my own oral presentations may lead to
misrepresentations, since I often and intentionally add value to my
presentations by talking.  Such talking may even include questioning
the veracity of intentionally false information for classical
pedagogical purposes.
