	<h1>Thanks</h1>

	<p>Thanks for joining us for our Statistics for Machine
	Learning and Big Data course.  Thanks, too, for your feedback
	to help us improve the course in future sessions.
	</p>

	<p>
	    As promised, here's a <a href="stats-intro.zip">zip file</a> of
	    the slides and code samples.  All of the code samples are now
	    IPython notebooks.  (I've uploaded the <a href="titanic.zip">Titanic notebook</a>
	    separately.)  In case it's of interest, I've also posted a
	    zip file of the <a href="spam.zip">spam</a> data sets
	    (107&nbsp;MB compressed, 359&nbsp;MB uncompressed).  We
	    used the Enron corpus in class, the attached link includes
	    also the SpamAssasin corpus.  I've included here only the
	    part useful for training our classifier and in the right
	    form for the exercise.</p>

	

	<p style="color:#2222CC;">This document and the above links will remain valid for
	    three weeks, until 5 May 2015.
	</p>

	<p>The full Enron corpus is available directly from many
	    sources.  As usual, <a
	    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_Corpus">Wikipedia</a>
	    offers a good summary and <a
	    href="http://www.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/">direct
	    links</a> to the corpus.  The SpamAssassin <a
href="https://spamassassin.apache.org/publiccorpus/">public corpus</a>
	    is similarly available in its entirety online.
	</p>


	<h2>Next Steps</h2>

	<p>
	    Don't stop now!  Trainings are most useful if you apply
	    what you've learned within the few weeks following the
	    course.  Think of ways to use statistical significance,
	    regression, and classification algorithms in your daily life,
	    even if the uses aren't perfect.  The immediate goal is to get
	    yourself to use this knowledge so it becomes a part of
	    you.</p>

	<p>One path we mentioned at the end of Wednesday is the <a
	    href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic-gettingStarted">Kaggle
	    Titanic</a> challenge.  It's a great introductory-level,
	    but very real, challenge.  In addition, the site includes a
	    number of great getting started tutorials, notably <a
href="http://blog.kaggle.com/2015/04/08/new-video-series-introduction-to-machine-learning-with-scikit-learn/">this video</a>.
	</p>

	<p>Here are some additional reading suggestions to help keep
	you going:
	    <ul>
		<li><a
	href="https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~pedrod/papers/cacm12.pdf">Useful
		    Things to Know about ML</a>, a great article by
	Pedro Domingos with tips on the black art of using machine
		    learning effectively.</li>
		<li><a
	href="http://see.stanford.edu/materials/aimlcs229/ML-advice.pdf">Advice</a>
		    from Andrew Ng on applying ML.</li>
		<li>We used pandas in the spam classification
	exercise.  The web has many good introductions to pandas.
	Once you understand pandas a bit, I highly recommend <a
	href="http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/intro-to-pandas-data-structures/">Greg
		    Reda's</a> introduction to working with
		    DataFrames.  (The page includes a link to his
	conference talk, if you'd rather ingest the information by video.)  A
		    very complete introduction is <a
href="http://linkis.com/pandas.pydata.org/pa/IEWsK">this
	book</a>.</li>
		<li><a
href="http://radimrehurek.com/data_science_python/">Radim
	Rehurek's</a> talk on text ML is also quite good.  He presents
	a slightly different approach to spam filtering than we
	covered in class.
	    </ul>
	</p>

	<p>In addition, <a href="http://pyvideo.org/">pyvideo.org</a>
	is a great ressource for python and python tools learning.
	Here are a couple videos particularly worth watching:
	    <ul>
	    <li><a
	href="http://pyvideo.org/video/2577/ipython-in-depth-high-productivity-interactive-a-1">IPython
		in depth</a></li>
	    <li><a
href="http://pyvideo.org/video/2561/exploring-machine-learning-with-scikit-learn">Exploring
	Scikit-learn</a></li>
	    <li><a
	href="http://pyvideo.org/video/2614/diving-deeper-into-machine-learning-with-scikit-l">Diving
		deeper into scikit-learn</a></li>
	    <li>Skipper Seabold's <a
href="http://pyvideo.org/video/1200/statsmodels">Statsmodel</a>
	tutorial.
	    </ul>
	    In addition, PyCon 2015 videos will be going online in
	late April.
